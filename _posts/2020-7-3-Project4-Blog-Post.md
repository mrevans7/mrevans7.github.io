title: Project 2 Reflection

My vignette can be found [here](https://mrevans7.github.io/ST558_Project2/).

This was another project that I really enjoyed having the chance to work on. I have always been really fascinated by ensemble learning methods in R, so I was happy to have the chance to work with these a little bit more throughout this project. I also really enjoyed implementing the automation of RMarkdown. I have worked with RMarkdown a fair amount in my undergraduate classes, as I usually use it to write up my homework reports, but I did not know that it had the functionality of automation. This is definitely something that I could see myself using in a future career.
