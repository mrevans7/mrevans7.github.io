title: Project 1 Reflection

My vignette can be found [here](https://mrevans7.github.io/ST558_Project1/). 

Overall, I really enjoyed this project. I felt that it was a great opportunity to apply some of the basic exploratory analysis skills we have learned over the past couple of weeks to different sets of data. I really enjoyed that we had the freedom to analyze the data and create visualizations in a way we felt appropriate. While I felt that recreating visuals was helpful in the initial stages of learning the concepts, it was a nice challange to have to think about the best ways to visualize the data we were using.

If I did the project again, one thing I would do differently would be looking at data in contingency tables and then creating visualizations of that same data. While I did this for some of my contingency tables, I feel like it would have made my report flow better if I did it for all of the tables. This also would have allowed me to verify assumptions made about the data from looking at contingency tables, as the visualizations are generally a better way of seeing trends in the data.

The most difficult aspect of this project for me was thinking of how to visualize the data. I am not the biggest hockey fan, though I do understand the game, so I did not have a ton of ideas at first about how to best visualize the data. I had to think about what factors in the data could have an impact on others and thus, would be interesting to visualize together. Overall, I felt that the visualizations I came up with were appropriate for the data we were given and showed some interesting relationships in the data.

At the same time, that leads me to my biggest takeaway from this project. Even when you are not the most familiar with a set of data, you still have to work to get to a point of understanding the data well enough to analyze it appropriately, understand the findings, and draw conclusions. This is an important takeaway because when working for other people, you are not guaranteed to be an expert on the data you are analyzing. However, there is still an expectation that you will be able to apply your skills in a meaningful, worthwhile way.
