title: Mid-Point Course Reflection
---

Overall, I am really happy with how the course is going. I previously took an introduction to data science course at the undergraduate level, and I feel like this course has built on a lot of that information. It has helped me gain a better understanding of the concepts that I found confusing during that course. I am most happy about the improvements I have made in my programming with R. I am feeling very comfortable and confident using R, which I believe is helping me learn newer, trickier concepts better. 

I really enjoy the structure of the course. The lecture videos are broken into appropriate smaller chunks, which makes them a lot more manageable than diving into an hour and a half long lecture. I also feel like each homework covers a fair amount of content. In previous courses, I've been assigned homework less frequently, which can make it more difficult because each homework is a combination of multiple topics. With the structure of this course, I feel like I am taking time to solidify my understanding of each topic before continuing to build on it. The same goes for the projects that we are assigned. 

One recommendation I would have for a change of the course would be to reincorporate the questions throughout the lectures. These were in the first couple of lectures, and after taking the first test, I thought they were very helpful. The questions throughout the lecture were similar in style to the questions on the test, so it helped me think about what I would potentially be tested on (or more importantly, which concepts were important to have a solid understanding of). 

Otherwise, I'm looking forward to completing the rest of the course!
