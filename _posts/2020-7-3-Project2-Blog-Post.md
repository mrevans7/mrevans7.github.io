This was another project that I really enjoyed having the chance to work on. I have always been really fascinated by ensemble learning methods in R, so I was happy to have the chance to work with these a little bit more throughout this project. I also really enjoyed implementing the automation of RMarkdown. I have worked with RMarkdown a fair amount in my undergraduate classes, as I usually use it to write up my homework reports, but I did not know that it had the functionality of automation. This is definitely something that I could see myself using in a future career. 

If I had to go back and do this project differently, I would have spent more time learning about how to properly select variables for a regression model. I selected the initial seven variables for my exploration simply based off of my interest in them. They were variables that I believed would have an impact on the model. When it came to selecting which of these seven variables to include in the actual regression model, I created five base models to compare. I know there are other ways of doing this that will be covered in courses involving regression, which I am really looking forward to learning about more. 

The most difficult part for me was figure out what needed to go in each document. I initially started out with my README file being the file that would have the parameters listed and automated. However, I quickly ran into trouble with that. To get around this issue, I made a new document that had the automation and changed the README to be a listing of all of the automated files. Another thing I struggled with was how to automate the file based on the parameter. I used my knowledge of dplyr to create a new variable that could then be filtered based off of a given weekday. 

One of my biggest take-aways from this project was learning ways to make data more usable. For example, I felt like my creation of the variables "Weekday" and "Channel" made the data more usable because you did not need to look at multiple columns to find the information you wanted. Rather, the new variable would tell you the information you were looking for. I feel like this speaks to how my skills in R have progressed, as I am learning new ways to manipulate data. Another take-away was the automation aspect of the project. This has so many useful applications, and I am looking forward to using it more moving forward.
